	Gweek is used for communications skills assessment.
Gweek scoring formula is SECRET.
But how do they determine scores: Using the umm, pauses, confidence etc etc to analyze that whether the person is speaking spontaneously or just blabbering.

WE DONT HAVE THE VIDEO
CANNOT TRACK THE EYE MOVEMENT
GWEEK  PIPELINE:
	1 to 2 minutes recording---> Features Extracted from GWEEK., Number of pauses identified by autogweek(gweek propriety software) we are going to use it for future.
PARAMETERS FOR LABELLING:
	Filled pauses, prolonged vowel words.. Aaaa, eeeee, iiiii uuuum etc

Speaker speaks something---->features extracted by software--->input score enters algorithms--->score generated by algorithm

About this resource:
 




From internet we got the annotated data for planned speech and read text and what we are going to do is this that we are going to  put it through an BLACK BOX Neural networks, Or recurrent neural networks. (or deep learning algorithm) to analyze it and do stuff.

Secondly we are going to use the JSON file generated by the gweek adn also the direct audio file to classify between the read text and PLANNED speech and then we are going to compare the two resutls and also combine the two results and post some inference that we got from these results. THE results will also give us some insights about THE current goodness or badness of the auto-gweek, (the gweek json file generator). (either it is good or bad etc)





Thirdly for the Gweekscore vs the lexical variety task we are going to use statistical techniques and probabilistic techniques to find the co-realatons between these
