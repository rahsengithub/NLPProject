API: Read the document given by David.
Have had a few questions and organised a call with him.

MOM - 
1. Write a simple python module that will upload all the required .wav files that have been split into 2-minute chunks to the API provided by Gweek. Make sure that the file is atleast of 16 KHz frequency, otherwise the accuracy retrieved will not be satisfactory.

2. Get a University laptop from the Computer Science department and use it as a makeshift webhook that can be accessed by the Gweek API to spit out the converted wav to JSON files.

3. Check the authorisation (bearer token)

4. Establish the connectivity between the systems (a little tricky)
